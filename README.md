# Luxxy Covid Testing Cloud Application
A MultiCloud based full-stack application to collect and manage personal data of visitors in a hotel resort management.

Visitors require a negative Covid test result in order to book their stay. The web application interacts with Google Cloud SQL database to store personal information of the users, and AWS S3 to store their Covid test results (as PDF files). The application runs on a Kubernetes cluster hosted on GCP. The infrastructure and resource provisioning for this system is automated using Terraform.
